    Stas Sergeev <stsp@users.sourceforge.net> says this screenshot shows
    the correct Russian legacy layout.
    
    This puts “;” on the 8 key just like the “ru(legacy)” xkb
    keyboard layout does. But there are some differences to the
    “ru(legacy)” xkb layout:
    
    - “(” and “)” are on the  “~” and “`” keys
    - “/” is on the shifted “3” key
    - the shifted “4” key gives “¤” instead of “*”
    - the shifted “9“ key gives “?”
    - the shifted “0” key gives “%”
    - “ё” and “Ё” are on the “/” and “?” keys

    Use better localized names for the rusle table
    
    Because of LANGUAGES = ru (or LANGUAGES = ru_RU), the (possibly
    translated) language name is added as a prefix to the (possibly
    localized) long name of the input method anyway when displayed by in
    the Gnome control centre or in the input method selection menu of
    gnome. When listing with “ibus list-engine” it is in the section for
    the language.
    
    Therefore, adding the language again as a prefix to the input method
    name or the localized input method names is superfluous.
    
    Using the language only in localized tables names, i.e.
    
        NAME.ru = устаревшая
    
    instead of
    
        NAME.ru_RU = устаревшая
    
    requires ibus-table >= 1.9.1.

    Make status prompts and symbols more consistent
    
    - Use status prompt “^_^” for emoji-table instead of “CN”
      The icon ibus-emoji.svg also looks similar.
    - Use status prompt “Ć” instead of “C” for compose.txt
      Looks nicer, compose is about typing accents.
      It also looks more like the icon that way.
    - Make sure that all tables have both status prompts and symbols
      (They can be the same always).

    Change MAX_KEY_LENGTH from 2 to 1 for the rusle, rustrad, thai, and yawerty tables.
    
    The comments why MAX_KEY_LENGTH was set to 2 said:
    
        “changed to 2 to fake col prob in sqlite db”
    
        “It is supposed to be 1 but need to be 2 to avoid schema mismatch
        bug in optimize_database() in ibus-table.”
    
    So this was probably a workaround for some bug in ibus-table,
    probably it had something to do with the old database format
    where each input key was stored in a different column.
    
    With the current ibus-table dataformat, there is no problem
    in using the correct value MAX_KEY_LENGTH=1.

    Use SELECT_KEYS = F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8,F9 for ipa-x-sampa
    
    Requires ibus-table >= 1.8.4.
    
    Select keys like F1, F2, F3, ... are necessary for the ipa-x-sampa

    Add single and multi wildcard options to all tables
    
    Since ibus-table 1.8.3, the default for single and multi wildcards is
    empty (Because the most natural way to switch off wildcards seems to
    be to make the value of the wildcard options the empty string).
    
    Therefore, for the tables where wildcard support is useful, wildcard
    options should be added to have wildcards switched on by default.

    Use AUTO_WILDCARD = TRUE for all tables
    
    For ibus-table <= 1.8.0, the AUTO_WILDCARD option was ignored.
    A multi wildcard was *always* appended to the end of the input
    string, no matter how the AUTO_WILDCARD option was set in the table source file.
    
    But for ibus-table > 1.8.0, the AUTO_WILDCARD option is finally read
    from the tables and used. But setting it to FALSE is useful only for
    very special tables, for all tables in this repository, AUTO_WILDCARD
    should be set to TRUE.
    
    “yawerty.txt”, “rustrad.txt”, and “thai.txt” are tables which work either
    way, no matter whether AUTO_WILDCARD is set to TRUE or FALSE because
    in these tables, all possible input sequences have only one key.
    
    “cns11643.txt”, “mathwriter-ibus.txt”, “translit-ua.txt”,
    “translit.txt”, and “viqr.txt” really need AUTO_WILDCARD = TRUE,
    they won’t work with AUTO_WILDCARD = FALSE.
    
    “mathwriter-ibus.txt” also had the bug to use the options
    USE_FULL_WIDTH_PUNCT and USE_FULL_WIDTH_LETTER which do not exist.
    ONLY DEF_FULL_WIDTH_PUNCT and DEF_FULL_WIDTH_LETTER exist.  I think
    these should be set to FALSE for mathwriter-ibus.txt.

    Also, ibus does not use the option “KEYBOARD_LAYOUT”, the correct
    name of that option is just “LAYOUT”.

    Set symbols to be displayed in IM switchers
    An attempt has been made to match the icon for each table. Not all tables
    have been touched; where the icon did not have a clear relationship to a
    single Unicode character, no change has been made.

    Set KEYBOARD_LAYOUT in translit.txt and translit-ua.txt to “Unknown”
    
    Daniil uses äüöÄÖÜ in these tables. These are not available
    on the US_Default layout. Therefore, it is probably better to
    set the keyboard to “Unknown” because the comment says this
    means to accept any kind of layout.

    Supported languages should not be left empty in a table.
    
    For an input method which has LANGUAGES set to an empty string,
    nothing at all is shown by ibus when trying to change to that input
    method using the trigger key which makes the input method hard to
    select.
